Quality Architecture Philosophy

I believe quality is a system-level architectural concern, not a phase
in the SDLC. My approach to Quality Architecture focuses on designing
testability into systems from the outset, using automation as an
enabling platform rather than a verification afterthought.
Key principles include:
• Quality built into architecture, pipelines, and delivery workflows
• Automation frameworks treated as long-lived platforms
• Test strategy aligned to risk, business value, and system complexity
• Observability, telemetry, and feedback loops as first-class quality
signals
• Strong collaboration between QA, engineering, product and AI :-)
I regularly write about Quality Architecture, test automation strategy,
and system thinking in QA on my blog:
